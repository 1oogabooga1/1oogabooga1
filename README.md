# 👋 Hi, I'm Dmitrii Dobrydin

Java backend developer • Spring Boot • PostgreSQL/Liquibase • Hibernate/Sql2o • Exploring AI/NN

#### About me:
I enjoy building Spring Boot apps — from UI with Thymeleaf to DB schema versioning with Liquibase. I’ve also built Telegram bots with complex multi-step conversation logic, and I’m currently exploring AI/NN.
